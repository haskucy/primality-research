# search-prime
Code and script for finding prime numbers and other associated information.

## Things I Need To Do
1. Implement isprime() with 6x+y for faster calculation
2. Implement isprime() with nx+y for faster calculation
3. Implement isprime() with non bruteforce method
4. Implement allprime()
